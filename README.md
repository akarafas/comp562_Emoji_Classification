Group Members: Angel Karafas, Dana Rubin, and Emily Stahle

Our final project for Machine Learning (Comp562) will be logistic regression on a group of around 100 emojis. We aim to classify how emojis are used in today's emoji filled world. We will use the skills learned from Machine Learning, as well as resources online.
